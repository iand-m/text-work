Text Work

I'm doing an independent study in the course of my studies in Sonic Arts at Brooklyn College looking at ways of analyzing, splitting, and manipulating audio files of spoken voice.
This is a repository of Python scripts and related materials developed for that purpose.

The Max/MSP Project folder contains all the externals used in the project as well as a sampling of files from the corpus for demo purposes.
